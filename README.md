## Health Monitoring and Analysis
# Project Overview
This project leverages Python to monitor and analyze health-related data, aiming to provide insights into various health metrics over time. It involves collecting, cleaning, and visualizing data related to health indicators (e.g., heart rate, activity levels, sleep patterns). The projectâ€™s goal is to support better health management by identifying trends and suggesting actionable improvements.

# Features
Data Import and Cleaning: Processes and cleans data from various sources to ensure quality analysis.
Visualization: Generates visualizations to track health metrics such as heart rate, activity, and sleep patterns.
Trend Analysis: Detects patterns in health metrics over time to support deeper insights.
Anomaly Detection: Flags unusual variations in health indicators for potential follow-up.
Project Structure
data/: Raw health data files, such as heart rate or sleep activity records.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
src/: Python scripts for data processing and feature extraction.
output/: Processed data and analysis outputs.
README.md: Documentation for the project (this file).
Installation
