# Health-Monitoring-and-Analysis-using-Python
Health Monitoring and Analysis refers to the systematic use of health data to track and evaluate the health status of individuals or populations over time. It contains a range of activities from real-time physiological data collection (like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) to the analysis of more complex health records (including patient history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information)
Health Monitoring and Analysis: Getting Started
The problem I am working on in this article is my take on a problem statement I found at statso. The dataset we are working with contains the following columns:

PatientID: Numerical identifier for the patient.
Age: Age of the patient in years.
Gender: Gender of the patient.
HeartRate: Heart rate in beats per minute.
BloodPressure: Blood pressure readings, formatted inconsistently.
RespiratoryRate: Respiratory rate in breaths per minute.
BodyTemperature: Body temperature in Fahrenheit.
ActivityLevel: Activity level at the time of the measurement.
OxygenSaturation: Oxygen saturation percentage.
SleepQuality: Quality of sleep reported by the patient.
StressLevel: Reported level of stress.
Timestamp: Date and time of the measurement.

# Summary
So, Health Monitoring and Analysis contains a range of activities from real-time physiological data collection (like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) to the analysis of more complex health records (including patient history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information).
